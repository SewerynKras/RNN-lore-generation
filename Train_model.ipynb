Power had been obtained from the bargains, and the City needed power. Knowledge had been gleaned, and the Ahamkara knew answers to questions no one had known to ask.\\nBut the price was too high. And no edict or forbearance seemed to stop Guardians from seeking them out, driven by hope, or vengeance, or despair.\\nThe call had to be silenced. So the Great Hunt did its work.\\nAnd thus the Ahamkara were made extinct, their call silenced, their solipsistic flatteries erased, their great design - if it ever existed - broken.\\nOf this you can be assured, oh reader mine.␃',\n",
       " 'Ghost Fragment: Warlock': \"Why did I set her on the trail?\\nYou try and try and try to explain, but no one ever understands. No one who's not a Warlock. Who hasn't spent a dozen years scouring the ruins for one string of symbols, one clean code, one black talon. Titans just make a hmphing noise, if they've stayed awake. Hunters clean their nails with their knives and look at you like you've grown a third eye.\\nBut when you've spent your life searching through arcana for ancient power, you have the urge to reach out and educate others. Especially if you've had one too many.\\nNah, she's not my type at all. We've played dice, cards, war games, you know, the usual stuff. I'd never tried to show off before. I don't know what came over me.\\nI had a broken vertebrae in my pocket that I'd borrowed from - yes, borrowed, I was going to put it back - what do you think you are, my conscience? It was a fossil, that means mineral replacement, a rock, basically. They can survive a few hours in my pocket. Do shut up.\\nThe Cryptarchs weren't going to miss it. Everyone knows the Ahamkaras were hunted to extinction. There's nothing to be afraid of anymore.\\nThink of how mysterious this system is, I said. How much life sprang up when the Traveler came. Like the Ahamkara. Do you know the legends? The dragon that made promises? And I pulled out the fossil with a flourish - \\nShe pulled out her knife and started to pick the dirt from her nails. That set me off.\\nYou could never have brought down one of these, I said. Ever. Not the greatest Hunter, not the brawniest Titan.\\nHer eyes narrowed. She said, Oh? Is that so? And I saw right then that she wasn't going to pass on the challenge.\\nI've murdered a Guardian, I thought. She's going to die. It'll be my fault.\\nAnd I looked at the piece of spine in my hand and wondered - why did I say that? What moved me to such pride?␃\",\n",

       " 'Lord Gheleon': 'Gheleon wears three knives. Their names are Swiftling, Occam, Quietus. They did much of the work at Black Lona, in silence and at speed.\\nBetween the roots of the ash tree that covers his den, Gheleon has stacked the Fallen bones collected from that one-night operation. The scavenged pieces of an Ahamkara, several jumbled coyote skeletons, and a fossil mastodon skull are mixed in with them. The bones are scorched and battered from the various grenades, bullets, and hammers he\\'s taken to them. He keeps extensive notes on these stress tests in a tattered notebook with \"Field Armor Experiments\" scrawled on its cover. So far, though, he hasn\\'t tried his knives on these materials. Between bones, in the joints and gaps, certainly, but not on them.\\nGheleon flips Swiftling and catches it by the haft. He throws it, a single smooth motion, and it shatters a Fallen tibia.\\nHe flips Occam and throws it. The knife clatters off an Ahamkara vertebra.\\nHe flips Quietus and-\\n\"Shanks and pikes, Efrideet!\"\\n\"Ooh, that\\'s the last yip it\\'s yipped,\" she says, picking up the coyote jaw that Quietus impaled. \"Helmet, would you say?\"\\n\"Too brittle. Etherbone\\'s better. Flexes.\"\\nThe others follow her in, wrinkling their noses. Usually they avoid his dim and earth-smelling den. Their presence suggests that Felwinter is doing something unpleasant, probably involving screams.\\n\"Bone?\" Saladin says. \"Not carbon bronze? Not plasteel?\"\\n\"Bone\\'s always available as a last resort. Nothing else is.\"\\n\"This is doomsday thinking,\" Jolder says, kicking aside fragments of bone. \"We have your back. Our plate is strong. When\\'ll you need scavenged armor?\"\\n\"If all of you were cut down around me, your Light drained past return, and my own armor was shredded. F\\'r instance.\"\\nThere is a long silence.\\n\"You always know what to say to make us feel better,\" Efrideet says.\\n\"I could hide under your bodies until the threat left.

       " 'Osiris': \"What drives a Warlock to madness?\\nGhosts choose those suited to war and heroism to be reborn. By nature or circumstance they go to battle against the Darkness, and through this battle they learn how to use the Light. But Warlocks, by their nature, fight a second, internal war. This is the war to understand a universe of secrets- a world that expects Guardians to fight without full knowledge of what they are or what they might hope to achieve.\\nYou were a mighty warrior. I watched you at Six Fronts, and heeded the call of Saint-14 to appoint you Vanguard Commander, even when the Concordat claimed to have records proving you were a Golden Age experiment mis-incarnated as a human by an inept Ghost. Saint-14 assured me you were just a man without much patience for obfuscation.\\nI watched as you grew tired of strike missions and the grueling, unproductive sessions with the Cryptarchs. That was when I took you under my wing. I saw our future in you. But your curiosity was voracious- How much of a Guardian's personality and memories were true? How much had been fabricated by their Ghost? Did Guardians share particular personality traits- a willingness to yield to authority, a tendency to do anything anyone asked for the promise of uncertain reward, a blind knight-errant mentality? Had the Traveler manufactured all of you as living weapons?\\nI admit, I found your questions divisive and disloyal, and I feared you might be capable of breaking our unity when the City's position had grown so tenuous. Why divert attention away from the Traveler, our only hope?\\nAnd then it got worse, dabbling in thanatonautics, Ahamkara-lore, chasing after Xur and the tricks of the Nine. Launching expeditions into the Reef and beyond at a time when ships were irreplaceable. Your quest split Guardians along ideological lines. This was your greatest crime: Hunters chose to pursue your visions instead of protecting refugees, Titans assembled teams to chase the legendary Vault of Glass instead of striking the Fallen, and Warlocks turned away from the study of the Traveler in favor of  your  ultimate obsession... learning the exact nature of the Darkness.\\nWhen debate became argument, and argument became acrimony, I realized you had already become a cult of personality, attracting Guardians who wanted a clear idea of why they were fighting, what they faced, and how they would ultimately win.\\nI don't know where you have gone, but I can no longer send Ghosts out to find you. Some come back- with tales of your death or how you went seeking answers from the far reaches of space and time. That you found a way to explore the Vex gate networks. That you've made breakthrough after breakthrough as to their origins- theories that a Guardian could not be simulated, that the Traveler might be an ontoformer or a god-incubator, that the Vex had diverged into multiple groups in order to secure 'an end state for every possible configuration of reality'.\\nI fear you have become as obsessed with the Vex as Toland was with the Hive. I've heard your own insane prophecies about pits and dead Hive kings. And of Crota, which now I cannot deny. \\nI hear stories of Lord Shaxx meeting with fireteams of Warlocks who have no shadow and never blink. Of jumpships slipping into the Reef on cold trajectories and meeting no intercept. Of questions hidden in matter engrams and answers decrypted on distant battlefields. \\nPerhaps you are still out there. If this reaches you, I would very much like to speak with you, to hear your theories in your own words.\\nPerhaps what drives a Warlock to madness is truth.␃\",\n",
       " 'The City Age': \"When did the City Age begin? Perhaps when the bulk of the world's survivors lived beneath the Traveler, rather than in the wilderness. Or when the Titans raised the first wall. Or at Six Fronts, when the City first faced coordinated, overwhelming attack - and repelled it decisively.\\nThe City did not rise without struggle. Warlords and wilderness fiefdoms clung to power. Starvation, disease, and anarchy menaced. But the Guardians held the frontier, and the children of the Golden Age kept the fire burning through the long climb back.\\nLegends walk through this history. The Iron Lords. Saint-14's crusade against the Fallen. The mask of the Speaker. The great Ahamkara Hunt. Toland's madness. Terrible Faction Wars - and the horrifying, disastrous effort to retake the Moon. \\nAs the City learned to walk again, it found a world overrun by alien menace. It faced disaster and defeat. Even in recent years, as Guardians begin to venture back to the Moon and the inner planets, the City's territory has withdrawn - outer sections abandoned and converted into fortifications in the wake of the Battle of Twilight Gap.\\nBut the City's shipwrights and foundries hum with energy. The probability kilns and work cooperatives produce new wonders. The Darkness is rising again. But so is the Light.␃\",\n",

All who eat of it are filled with the ecstatic certainty that they serve a great and necessary purpose.\\nThen sayeth Savathûn, \"Siblings, listen, we must part ways a while, so that we may grow different.\" She flies her war-moons into the black hole. Her throne becomes distant.\\nSayeth Xivu Arath, \"King Oryx, you take up too much space, your power constrains too many choices. I must go away from you.\" She flies her war-moons away into the night. Her throne is barred shut.\\nThen Oryx was alone. He spent a while in thought, and those thoughts are recorded here.␃'}"

We live short, hard lives. We die in the dark. The storm above us will never end. And soon the God-Wave will take us all. Above us there are only stormjoys, monsters, and moons of apocalypse. Let us go down, down, where we may discover truth, some power to avenge ourselves upon our betrayers, some hope of survival.\\nThe Leviathan's Hope\\n-What power calls you++\\n++Down to the deep?-\\n++What instinct draws you-\\n-Away from high hope?++\\n-Quick-breeding krill people, I tell you++\\n++For eons I have watched your struggle-\\n-Clinging to the sharp edge of survival++\\n++Balanced between the Deep and the Sky.-\\n++You were my treasure-\\n-My proof against despair++\\n-FOR THIS IS THE DEEP CLAIM-\\n++Existence is the struggle to exist-\\n-When the struggle seems lost++\\n++when the safe place crumbles-\\n-everything turns to the Deep to survive++\\n++I REJECT THE DEEP CLAIM++\\n-You will turn back, sweet krill of hope.±±\\n++You will choose the Sky instead.-\\nXi Ro's Protest\\nYou are huge and old!
